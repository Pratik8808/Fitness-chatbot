Fitness Chatbot
This project is a fitness chatbot developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide users with advice on fitness topics such as workouts, diet, hydration, and motivation. The chatbot utilizes machine learning techniques to classify user inputs and provide relevant responses based on predefined fitness-related intents.

Features:
Interactive Chatbot: Allows users to ask fitness-related questions and receive personalized advice.
Fitness Intent Recognition: Trained to recognize user queries on exercise routines, nutrition, hydration, and motivation.
Conversation History: Logs user-chatbot interactions in a CSV file for review and reference.
Streamlit Interface: A simple and user-friendly web interface created using the Streamlit library.
Technologies Used:
Python: The main programming language used for implementing the chatbot logic.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for text processing, including tokenization and text preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: Implements machine learning with a Logistic Regression classifier to predict user intents based on input.
Streamlit: Used for building the interactive web interface.
CSV: Stores user inputs and chatbot responses, providing a conversation history.
